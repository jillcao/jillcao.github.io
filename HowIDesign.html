					<h3>My roots in design</h3>
					<p>My PhD work was all about designing for a special kind of designers - end-user
					programmers. I had a lot of fun rummaging through decades of design research, gleaning
					treasures here and there. Some of the key pieces I savored and have found helpful
					throughout my design career include Donald Sch√∂n's reflective practice, especially the
					Reflection-in-Action model which describes how designers work and creativity literature's
					ideation concept.</p>
					
					<h3>My design processs</h3>
					<p>My central design process revolves around the ideate-prototype-test cycle. 
						<ul>
							<li>Ideate through brainstorming and sketching.</li>
							<li>Prototype in low- or high-fidelity.</li>
							<li>Test with users to learn their reactions to the design.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<h3>My role in the design process</h3>
					<p>I love the philosophy behind Participatory Design that design is a democratic process.
					I belief that users, stakeholders as well as everyone on the team needs a channel to
					express their opinions. The benefits are multitude. First, more minds, better ideas.
					The more ideas get considered, the better the final ideas would be.  Second, the more
					ideas get produced and evaluated in a time period, the faster the design will converge.
					This always helps to speed things. Last but not least, people will automatically own the
					design because it's their ideas we are talking about, not a single person's. </p>
					<p>Because of this, I see myself as a facilitator that glues the team together as we are
					working on a project. I begin by working with my team to understand project goals and
					plan user research with them closely. For example, you'd find my lead developer and I
					crafting a user interview guide in his office. Collaborating with my team, I also
					conduct research and analyze the data we gather so that when we get to the design phase,
					people trust the findings as well as understand its full context to be able to make
					design decisions about them. When we are in design land, I hold collaborative design
					sessions where we brainstorm ideas and draw interfaces. I also partner with my teams to
					test ideas as soon as we can whether it's grabbing somebody at the cafeteria to show a
					sketch or running full-fledged usability testing session with external customers in our
					lab. </p>
					
					<h3>Samples of my design process</h3>
					<p>All projects are different. I vary my design approach based on project needs and
					constraints. The following are some of the projects that contain flavors of the design
					process that I've described above. Please click on the individual projects to see what
					processes I used to tackle the design challenges I encountered.</p>
					
					<table>
						<tr><th>Project</th><th>Design process highlights</th><th>Design challenges</th></tr>
						<tr><td><a href="PauseMATLAB.html">Pause MATLAB execution</a></td><td>Highly collaborative with many rounds of brainstorming, sketching, evaluating pros and cons of design options.</td><td>One interface for users with very different programming expertise.</td></tr>
						<tr><td><a href="IdeaGardenHome.html">Idea Garden</a></td><td>Designing to deliver relevant content at the right time through a non-intrusive communication style by leveraging users' motivation to complete their job.</td><td>How to design a system that teaches users whose primary goal isn't to learn?</td></tr>
