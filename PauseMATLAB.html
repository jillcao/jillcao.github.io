					<p>Time frame: 2014 - 2015</p>
					<p><b>Project goal:</b> This feature enables users to pause MATLAB execution in the GUI
					on demand.</p>
					<p><b>Design challenges & approach:</b> Pausing the execution of MATLAB code has been
					requested by users over the years. For example, many users would like to stop their
					running code to check intermediate results to make sure the code is doing what they
					expect it to do before continuing with the execution. However, the pause behavior is not
					intended for all users. In fact, some users, when inadvertently invoking the behavior,
					would become confused because their code would appear to have “stopped working” suddenly.
					Thus, the design challenge was how to make the feature discoverable by its target users
					while remaining unobtrusive to those who do not need it. </p>
					<p>I approached the design challenge by facilitating a series of collaborative design
					sessions where the teams brainstormed design ideas, sketched out UIs, and design
					workflows. We also considered each design idea’s pros and cons and ranked the ideas
					based on how well they were expected to work under the design constraints we were faced
					with.</p>
					<p><b>Collaboration challenges & approach: </b>I was brought onto the project when it
					had stalled: the two teams disagreed on what users expected of the feature. After
					talking to the stakeholders on both teams, I devised a strategy to solve this problem
					to help the project gain traction. Specifically, my strategy consisted of establishing
					alliance with the other team’s UX specialist, actively seeking buy-in from the other
					team’s engineers, and delivering on my part as quickly as possible. Using this strategy,
					I helped the project gain momentum and progress toward a successful completion.</p>
					
					<p><b>Summary of UX methods and their goals</b></p>
					<table>
						<tr><th>UX method</th><th>Goal</th></tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Guerilla email “interviews”</td>
							<td>To quickly understand users’ goals, existing workflows, and pain points when lacked the resources for full-fledged user interviews. </td></tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Use case analysis</td>
							<td>To aggregate use cases using data from guerilla email “interviews” and years of customer request data </td></tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Collaborative requirements elicitation sessions</td>
							<td>To reach a consensus on what users’ needs are and to come up with requirements as a team.</td></tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Collaborative design sessions (brainstorming, sketching, critiquing, & prioritizing)</td>
							<td>To collaboratively brainstorm and sketch design ideas, consider each idea’s pros and cons, and prioritize the ideas based on design constraints.</td></tr>

					<p><b>Results and impact:</b> Downstream team’s team lead praised that the use
					cases were just what was needed to move the project forward. The use cases I
					created highlighted where teams disagreed and helped them form a shared
					understanding of what users wanted based on real data. My work also enabled
					the teams to form requirements and engage in design sessions where we
					brainstormed design ideas and prioritized them.
