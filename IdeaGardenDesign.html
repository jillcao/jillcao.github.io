					<p>The key design recommendation derived from the user research was for the system to help
					users generate more ideas when they are stuck, especially ideas to help them to reframe the
					problem at hand.  In this section, I will first describe the design concept that I came up
					with to address this design recommendation. I will show a slice of the design solution and walk
					you through how I arrived at the solution, including my design process and some of the design
					artifacts generated along the way.
					</p>
					<h3>The Idea Garden design concept</h3>
					<p>To address the key design recommendation, I developed a design concept called Idea Garden.
					An Idea Garden is an extension of a programming environment that offers ideas to users who are
					stuck. Its goal is to help users help themselves as opposed to solving users' problems for them.
					In this sense, an Idea Garden is a partner to the user rather than an automated problem-solver.

					<h3>A slice of the design solution: Table tooltip feature</h3>
					<p>Based on the design concept, a design solution is the Table Tooltip feature (for IBM
					CoScripter). This feature encourages a new workflow where users generate more ideas with the
					system's help: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>User is stuck.</li>
						<li>Idea Garden shows an icon.</li>
						<li>User hovers over the icon, a tooltip appears.</li>
						<li>User reads it and gets a new idea.</li>
						<li>User tries out the idea and succeeds.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h3>My design process</h3>
					<p>I followed a 4-step, iterative design process to create and refine Idea Garden features
					like the Table Tooltip. 
					</p>
					<img src="" />
					
					<h3>Design challenges and guidelines</h3>
					<p>To address the design recommendation, there were a few challenges. I developed design
					guidelines to help guide the design solution toward solving those challenges. 
					</p>

					<p>I followed a 4-step, iterative design process to create and refine Idea Garden features
					like the Table Tooltip.

					<table>
						<tr><th>Design challenges</th><th>Design guidelines</th></tr>
						<tr><td><b>Content:</b> What information does a user need to generate more ideas to solve a programming problem?</td><td>A suggestion should include both strategy information and programming knowledge. </td></tr>
						<tr><td><b>Timing:</b> When is the right time to deliver that information to users?</td><td>A suggestion should become available when users' data and actions indicate that they may be encountering a barrier.</td></tr>
						<tr><td><b>Communication style:</b> How to inform users of available information without interrupting their flow? A design goal was to let users remain in control of their attention.</td><td>A suggestion should adopt a negotiation interruption style to let users remain in control of their attention.</td></tr>
						<tr><td><b>Motivation:</b> How to attract users to relevant information so that they would follow up with that information and take action? </td><td>A suggestion should motivate users in two ways: (1) demonstrate its relevancy to users by contextualizing itself in users' recent actions and the data user has worked with, (2) connect to users emotionally through a personified character</td></tr>

					<h3>Solution ideas and prototypes</h3>
					<p>Below is a sample of design artifacts generated during the design process.

					<h3>Evaluate with users</h3>
					<p>Design is an iterative process. No designer can get it right the first time. See Usability Testing for how I evaluated my designs. </p>
